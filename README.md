# Web Threat Analysis with Machine Learning and Deep Learning
## Overview
This project implements web threat analysis using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages a variety of libraries to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance. The goal is to provide a robust framework for detecting and mitigating web-based threats such as malware, phishing, and other cybersecurity risks.

## Features
**Data Preprocessing**: Handles both numerical and categorical data.
**Machine Learning**: Includes a Random Forest Classifier for threat detection.
**Deep Learning**: Utilizes a neural network for advanced threat analysis.
**Data Visualization**: Visualizes data distributions and model performance.
**Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides tools for real-time analysis and response.

## Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
NetworkX: For network analysis (if applicable).
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizations.
Scikit-Learn: For machine learning preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training deep learning models.
